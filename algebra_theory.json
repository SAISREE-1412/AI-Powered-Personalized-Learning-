    "Theory": "A linear equation is an algebraic expression where the highest power of the variable is 1. It represents a straight line when graphed.",
    "Example_Question": "Solve 2x + 3 = 7",
    "Step_by_Step": "Step 1: Isolate variable term → 2x = 4. Step 2: Solve for x → x = 2. Step 3: Check by substituting → 2*2 + 3 = 7",
    "Tips": "Always perform the same operation on both sides of the equation to maintain equality.",
